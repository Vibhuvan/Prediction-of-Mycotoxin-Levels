# Prediction-of-Mycotoxin-Levels
#Overview

This project develops a machine learning pipeline to predict mycotoxin (DON concentration) levels in corn samples using hyperspectral imaging data. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, regression modeling, and deployment readiness.

#Features

Data preprocessing: handling missing values, normalization, and PCA.

Regression modeling: Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) with hyperparameter tuning.

Model evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and RÂ² score.
